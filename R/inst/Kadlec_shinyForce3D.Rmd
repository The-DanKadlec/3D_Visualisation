# Summary

`shinyForce3D` is an open-source R Shiny application that enables dynamic, interactive visualization of three-dimensional ground reaction force (GRF) data using animated force vector trajectories. The app supports real-time rendering of animated 3D vectors, static 3D visualizations with planar projections, two-dimensional time-aligned Pedotti plots of selected vector components, and decomposition of traditional Cartesian components (Fx, Fy, Fz) into polar coordinate representations (magnitude *r*, inclination *θ*, and azimuth *φ*) to aid interpretation.

Users can upload CSV files with trial-level force data, overlay multiple datasets for comparative analysis (e.g., between-limb, between-day, or between-cohort visualization), and export publication-quality figures and animations in common formats such as `.csv` and `.gif`.

In addition to its research applications, `shinyForce3D` is designed as a pedagogical tool for use in biomechanics and motor control education. By visualizing how GRF vectors evolve over time and across conditions, students can develop a more intuitive understanding of mechanical loading and movement dynamics than is typically afforded by traditional 2D plots.



# Statement of Need

Ground reaction force (GRF) vector analysis is a foundational tool in biomechanics for evaluating execution strategies, mechanical loading, and performance characteristics in sport and rehabilitation contexts. Traditionally, GRF data are presented as three independent 2D time-series (Fx, Fy, Fz), which obscures the vectorial nature of force and fails to capture inter-component dependencies. This reductionist representation may hinder interpretation of how force orientation, magnitude, and timing evolve dynamically across the stance phase.

In contrast, GRF is inherently a vector quantity—defined by magnitude and direction in three-dimensional space—whose full meaning is best preserved when represented in its native vectorial form. Visualizing GRF in three dimensions respects this three-dimensional structure, enabling more accurate depiction of the evolving vector. 

These limitations hinder not only exploratory research but also clear communication of findings, particularly in interdisciplinary or educational settings. By integrating 3D vector trajectories, Pedotti plots, and polar coordinate visualizations, `shinyForce3D` provides users with a richer and more coherent understanding of kinetic strategies.

Unlike traditional two-dimensional static plotting scripts, `shinyForce3D` offers a responsive, user-friendly interface tailored for biomechanics researchers, sports scientists, and educators. It is particularly well-suited for teaching vector-based reasoning and enhancing student comprehension of force dynamics through immediate, visual feedback.


#Features
•	Dynamic 3D Plot
	This tab provides an interactive three-dimensional rendering of the full GRF vector trajectory across the stance phase. Users can rotate, zoom, and explore the vector evolution in space, with optional overlays such as butterfly lines (vector paths) and peak force indicators. This mode offers a structural depiction of force, crucial for understanding how direction and magnitude co-evolve during movement.
	
•	Static 3D Plot
	The static plot generates dual orthographic projections (e.g., frontal and sagittal views) with optional 3D shadowing on anatomical planes, which is commonly used for most atheltic tasks (i.e. sprinting, jumping, decelerating, etc). These planar projections facilitate side-by-side comparison and allow users to examine differences between trials. This view supports static analysis and figure export while preserving spatial relationships between components. These figure are suitable for publications.
	
	•	2D Plot (Cartesian Coordinate)
	This tab shows conventional time-series plots of Fx, Fy, Fz, and the resultant vector across stance (i.e. time). Users can toggle between trial-level and mean ± SD visualizations, highlight peak values, and customize which components are displayed.
	
	•	2D Plot (Polar Coordinate)
	Force vectors are transformed into polar coordinates, decomposing each timepoint into magnitude (r), inclination (θ), and azimuth (φ), with optional angle display in degrees. This representation allows users to disentangle directional and magnitude changes, helping to reveal rotational strategies or orientation shifts that Cartesian time-series can obscure. It also facilitates intuitive reasoning about vector directionality.
	
	•	Pedotti Plot
	This plot maps any two selected GRF components (e.g., Fy vs. Fz) as time-evolving vectors from the origin, creating a continuous 2D vector field over stance. Animated and static options are available, with time encoded via color progression. Originally developed to visualize neuromotor control strategies, Pedotti plots are valuable for identifying coordination patterns, symmetry, and variability in multidimensional force application.
